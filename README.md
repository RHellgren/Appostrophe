The application gives you a blank canvas split into three panels. Hit the `+` button to add overlayed stickers to these. Once a sticker has been added it can be panned around to the desired position. Tap outside the highlighted sticker to lock it into place and unlock the canvas. Overlays snap into place once close to each other or the edges / center of the panels.
